# Programming_for_DA_projects
**Project number 1**

In this project, we aim to simulate a real-world phenomenon by creating a dataset using the numpy.random package rather than collecting actual data. The chosen dataset has been sourced from Kaggle and it's a survey conducted via Google Forms, focusing on students academic situations and mental health:

After analysing the data, we isolated four specific variables for analysis. We then proceeded to create for each variable, depending on its structure a random.distribution package in Python to synthesize similar data.

The primary objectives of this project are:
• Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.
• Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.
• Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.
• Detail our research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.

The four variables selected are as follows:
*Gender -- Age -- Do you have Depression? -- Did you seek any specialist for a treatment?*
